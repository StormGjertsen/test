    <h2>Cultural Diversity in Scotland</h2>
    <p>
        Scotland today is a mix of many different cultures. People from other countries have moved here for work, 
        study, and family life, and they bring their own food, music, and languages.
    </p>
    <p>
        This gives Scotland a modern and open identity while still keeping its old traditions alive.
        In bigger cities, you can find neighborhoods with food from countries like India, China, Italy,
        and many more places. You can also see different cultural festivals during the year that celebrate this mix of culture.
    </p>
    <p>
        Schools and workplaces often bring people from many backgrounds together. 
        This cultural diversity makes Scotland feel welcoming, and it shows how tradition and change can live side by side.
