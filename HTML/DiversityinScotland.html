    <h2>Cultural Diversity in Scotland</h2>
    <p>
      Scotland today is a mix of many different cultures. People from all over the world move to Scotland for work, 
      study and family life, bringing their own food, music and languages with them.
    </p>
    <p>
        This mix of different cultures gives the country an open identity while still taking care of their old and important traditions. 
        In some bigger cities you can find streets and neighborhoods with food and traditions from places like China, India, 
        Italy and many more places. You can also experience many other festivals in the country that celebrate this mix of culture.
    </p>
    <p>
        Schools and workplaces also help to bring the different people in Scotland together. The cultural diversity in the country 
        makes it feel welcome to everyone, and it shows how tradition and change can live side by side.
