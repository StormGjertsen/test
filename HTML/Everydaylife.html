    <h2>Everyday Life and Social Conditions</h2>
    <p>
        The everyday life in Scotland feels both traditional and modern at the same time. 
        In the cities people work normal jobs in offices, schools, shops and many more traditional jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
        In smaller villages around the country everyday life is quieter, and people know each other well. There are a lot of 
        weather changes and rain in Scotland, but people are used to it and continue with normal daily activities. Health care
        and education in Scotland are important parts of everyday life, Scottish healthcare
        is mostly free for everyone, and they have their own education system, different from the other countries in the UK.
    </p>
    <p>
        The social conditions in Scotland are not the same for everyone, but everyone cares about fairness and support for others. 
        This balance between school, work and community shows how everyday life in Scotland is shaped today.
