    <h2>Cities and Communities</h2>
    <p>
        Scotland’s cities are full of life and culture. Edinburgh, the capital, 
        is famous for its castle, old streets, and festivals. Glasgow is known for music, 
        shopping, and friendly people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aberdeen and Dundee are smaller cities but have their own character and history. Outside the big cities, there 
        are towns and villages where life is slower and closer to nature. Communities often gather in local halls, 
        schools, or sports clubs.
    </p>
    <p>
        This mix of large cities and small towns makes Scotland interesting to visit. 
        Each place has its own story, but they all show the same strong pride in being 
        Scottish and part of a community.
