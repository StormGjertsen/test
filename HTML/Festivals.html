    <h2>Festivals and Traditions</h2>
    <p>
        The different festivals in Scotland are an important way of showing the culture and identity in the country. The most famous 
        tradition is Hogmanay, which is the Scottish new year's celebration. People gather in the streets, sing, and watch fireworks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another important and well-known tradition is the Highland Games, where athletes from around the country compete each other in 
        things like caber tossing and hammer throwing, while people also wear kilts and play bagpipes to embrace the identity.
        The city of Edinburgh is home to the world's largest art festival, where artists and performers come from all over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Local towns and villages also celebrate with smaller festivals, with a lot of music and dancing. These traditions and 
        events in the country makes Scotland fun and lively and help connect people to the history of the past and present.
