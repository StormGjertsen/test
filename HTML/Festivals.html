    <h2>Festivals and Traditions</h2>
    <p>
        Festivals in Scotland are an important way of showing culture and identity. 
        The most famous is Hogmanay, which is the big New Year celebration. 
        People gather in the streets, sing, and watch fireworks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another well known tradition is the Highland Games, where athletes compete in events like caber tossing and tug of war, 
        while people wear kilts and play bagpipes. 
        The city Edinburgh is home to the world’s largest arts festival, where artists and performers come from all over the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
        Local towns also celebrate with smaller festivals, often with music and dancing.
        These traditions and events make Scotland lively, and they help connect people to both the past and the present.
