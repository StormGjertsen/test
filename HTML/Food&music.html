    <h2>Food, Music, and Modern Culture</h2>
    <p>
        Scottish food is much more that traditional meals like Haggis. In the cities of 
        Scotland, you will find different foods from all around the world, thanks to the cultural diversity in Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
        Music in Scotland is a big part of their history and personality, from traditional music like bagpipes and folk tunes
        to modern rock and pop songs. Film festivals and theaters are also important and show more of the creativity
        in the country. Finally, you can’t not acknowledge the sports scene in Scotland, where sports like football are very popular.
    </p>
    <p>
        This combination of modern and traditional culture makes Scotland a place where the old and the new can connect, 
        giving it its strong identity.
